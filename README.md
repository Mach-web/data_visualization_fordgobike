## Summary of Findings

The following features of the dataset were investigated through a variety of plots;duration_sec, start_time, start_station_id, bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender and bike_share_for_all_trip. The averege duration was usually lower among subscribers when 
compared to customers. The stations were not evenly distributed in the area. In general, visualization of bike ids gives the impression that newer bikes are preffered over older ones. Most bike rides were actually millenials. When a pie chart is plotted on member gender distribution, males are found to be around three quarters of entire share of riders. Most users actually prefer not to share their bike during a ride.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation,I first chose to focus on User type decision on start location and duration for ride. This was mainly to outline how most of the long duration bikers were actually customers. 
Secondly, I looked into Start stations vs Time of the day by bike_share_for_all_trip. This was mainly to outline how different the stations with ids of between 250 - 350 were actually different in nature. A further investigation would actually be needed.
Furthermore, I was eager to visualize how newer bikes were preffered over older ones. This was a clear indication that there was a difference in how the bikes were perceived.
In addition to this, I visualized how millenials were more into bike riding compared to the older generation.
